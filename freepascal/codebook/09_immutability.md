**How do I make const variables constant**?

Add a global directive {$J-} to your main pascal file.

**Why is const section writeable in by default**?

In Turbo Pascal 7.0, you could only assign values in the const section, not in var section.

As the official docs mentions, by default const is writeable (that is `{$J+}`) to keep Turbo Pascal compatibility.

It's a relic of old Delphi and Object Pascal and thus `{$J+}` is the default to allow old programs to compile, but it isn't required anymore.

Consider the following program. By the default `{$J+}```, you can change the gravity of the Earth, with the gravity of the Moon!

```pascal
program Immutability;

{$mode objfpc}{$H+}

const
  gravityEarth:Real = 9.81;

begin
  gravityEarth := 1.625; // Look, we are on the moon.
  WriteLn('The gravity on the Earth is ', gravityEarth:0:2);
end.
```

To make `const` variables behaving like const variables in modern programming languages, use {$J-}

```pascal
program Immutability;
{$mode objfpc}{$H+}{$J-}

const
  gravityEarth:Real = 9.81;

begin
  // With {$J-}, the following line will not compile
  // gravityEarth := 1.625;
  WriteLn('The gravity on the Earth is ', gravityEarth:0:2);
end.
```
