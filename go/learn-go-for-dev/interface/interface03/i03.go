/*
Interfaces Are Implemented Implicitly
=====================================

A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. Unlike in many other
languages, there is no explicit declaration of intent, there is no "implements"
keyword.

Implicit interfaces decouple the definition of an interface from its implementation.
You may add methods to a type and in the process be unknowingly implementing various
interfaces, and that's okay.

// Can a type fulfill multiple interfaces?
// Go uses the ____ keyword to show that a type implements an interface.
